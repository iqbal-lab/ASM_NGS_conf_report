Reference-free variant assembly methods have been shown to have unmatched accuracy in analysis of genetic sequence data, with the particular benefit of avoiding reference-bias and accessibility of a wider range of genetic variation than simple isolated SNPs. We have been building a framework, called Outbryk, for performing basic genomic epidemiology with the Cortex variation assembler. This report describes our state of progress of development, and the results of our analysis of the challenge data in the 2015 ASM Rapid NGS pipelines for genomic epidemiology conference.
