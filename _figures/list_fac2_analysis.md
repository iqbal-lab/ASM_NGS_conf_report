title: "Phage profiles of samples from facility 2 agree, and separate them from two CFSAN samples, in disagreement with the SNP-phylogeny"
description: "SRR2352236, SRR2352235, CFSAN007567 and CFSAN007549 cluster closley in the tree. However, their phage profile are significantly different with SRR2352235 SRR2352236 clustering together based on their phage profile."
